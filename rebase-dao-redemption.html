    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is a simulation for a redemption mechanism for the protocol to buy back SPA tokens at a "redemption price" between the RFV Backing Price and the Spot Price, when the spot price is lower than the RFV Backing Price. The goal is to provide a better incentive than selling, while being profitable for both the protocol and the user. For the user, the goal is to get more stablecoin value by redemption than by selling. For the protocol, the goal is to lose less treasury than it gains RFV Backing Price appreciation (ie, by buying back and hence burning more tokens for the same amount of treasury).

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The redeem threshold is a crucial parameter, it defines the redeem price offered relative to the distance between the RFV backing price and (lower) spot price, with 0% the redeem price = spot price, and 100% the redeem price = RFV backing price. The spot price is necessarily lower than the RFV Backing Price for the redemption to work. Try 50% for a null growth rate (ie, the protocol does not lose nor profit with redemption), or &lt;50% for a positive growth rate (ie, the protocol profits by buying SPA back at a discount compared to treasury). Obviously, with &gt;50%, the protocol obtains a negative growth rate, which means it loses more treasury than it increases the RFV Backing Price, which means it buys SPA back at a premium. With 100% (no Redeem Threshold, Redeem Price = RFV Backing Price), the RFV Backing Price stays the same, this is when the protocol loses the most.</li>
        <li>There is no check of account balance, so that you can "overborrow" and get into negative holdings, which will mess up the model :-) Checks could be implemented but it would complexify code much more, so please just don't do that!</li>
        <li>In general, if you get a negative value anywhere, then something went wrong and the result should not be relied upon, you should reset the simulation by refreshing the page!</li>
    </li>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Short analysis: one redemption</h2>
    <p>
        Protocol view: Offering a &lt;50% redemption rate allows the protocol to buy back via redemption more tokens and hence increase the RFV Backing Price more than it loses RFV Treasury. Since it is in net profit (ie, it buys back at a discount compared to the backing it has in treasury), redemption acts as an antidilution mechanism during contraction phases (ie, when spot price drops). The redemption threshold is crucial, as 50% allows for an equivalent exchange between RFV Backing Price and RFV Treasury, and thresholds &lt;50% increase the RFV Backing Price faster than the RFV Treasury gets depleted, hence ending up being a net profit for the protocol. This shows that redemption can be an elegant automated solution to counterbalance the dilution produced by staking and bonding durin expansionary phases. Redeem Max Size is unnecessary with one iteration of a redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users view: users who want to exit are always incentivized to use redemption during contraction phases, since they will always get a better redemption price than spot price. Arbitrageur can also buy the token on the market since the spot price is lower than the redemption price, to then do a redemption from the protocol, which is a net profit for them, and allows to raise the spot price on the market.
    </p>

    <h2>Short analysis: redemption/buy loops</h2>
    <p>
        Arbitrageurs are likely to take profit from this opportunity, by looping between redemption and then buying back SPA on the market before doing another redemption etc, increasing their stack of SPA or their DAI balance along the way at each step. In theory, we would expect that allowing a maximum of SPA to be redeemed in one go would be better, since redeeming leads to buying and hence to rising spot price and hence a higher redeeming price, which is less favorable for the protocol. To test whether this is true or not, a Max Redeem Size was implemented, and a liquidity market between SPA/DAI is simulated (which allows for Sell and Buy actions).
    </p>
    <p>
        Set the Max Redeem Size to a huge value, then try to loop redemption then buying then redemption etc until redemption gets disabled (when Spot Price &ge; RFV Backing Price). Although redemption works easily when a single redemption is done and the redemption threshold is set at &lt;50%, looping redemption/buy offsets the balance and the protocol ends up depleting the treasury faster than the RFV Backing Price increases, but both remain at reasonable levels ($23,000 remaining RFV Treasury and RFV Backing Price at ~$33). Interestingly, any value below or higher than 50% depletes the treasury more, and increases the RFV Backing Price less, than a 50% threshold, which suggests that per Romo's model, 50% is the optimal Redeem Threshold when there are redemption/buy loops by arbitrageurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that in an earlier version of this document, it was said that redemption looping could almost fully deplete the treasury. This was due to a refresh bug, which caused the check for redemption to be only done at redemption, but not at buy or sell. This bug allowed to activate redemption when it should have been disabled. This is akin to an Oracle Attack, which suggests that it is of the utmost importance that the Oracle providing the spot price for SPA should be very accurate and up-to-date, to avoid undue redemptions that could deplete the treasury. A safeguard is to set a Max Redeem Size, so as to limit the damage in case this happens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now set the Max Redeem Size to a lower value, e.g., 30 by default in this simulation. Then, try to redeem the max you can, in multiple steps, and then buy all at once (it doesn't matter whether you buy in one or multiple steps, there is no slippage nor fees in this simulation). You will now observe that the RFV Treasury gets slightly more depleted than with a huge (quasi-infinite) Max Redeem Size
    </p>
    <p>
        Now try another experiment with Max Redeem Size: try to set it at a lower value like before, such as 30, but now try to interleave each redemption with a buy, to simulate arbitrageurs buying on the market in parallel to arbitrageurs who already own SPA and are redeeming. You will notice that we end up with a slightly more depleted RFV Treasury, and a slightly less increased RFV Backing Price. This confirms our initial intuition that Redemption is more profitable to the protocol if done in bulk, because afterwards the Redeeming Price rises and hence it becomes more and more profitable for arbitrageurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence, Max Redeem Size is not a crucial parameter and actually counterproductive for the Redemption mechanism to work, but it still be interesting to implement but with a high value as a safeguard mechanism against potential Oracle Attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, this simulation identified one key risk of uncontrolled redeeming: the risk of almost complete treasury depletion, which happens only during an Oracle Attack. And two key parameters were identified for a more controlled and favorable redeeming mechanism: 1- Redeem Threshold (optimal value appearing to be 50% exactly), which defines the Redeem Price in-between the spot price and RFV Backing Price ; 2- An up-to-date Oracle to avoid abuse of Redeeming when it should be disabled. The simulation also demonstrates the benefits of a &lt;50% redemption mechanism below the backing price: 1) a constant buy pressure by arbitragers on markets that allows the price to remain close to the backing price, which can be helpful to avoid liquidations; 2) an additional (3,3) incentive when around the backing price, as hodlers can expect spot price to slowly increase over time since the backing price increases with redemptions. The downside is obviously a draining of the treasury since it is used to buy back the tokens from redeemers, but the draining is bounded with obviously a lower redemption threshold (ie, a smaller premium over spot price) draining treasury less as it benefits more the protocol while still benefitting arbitragers.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's worth noting that although this simulation only uses the RFV Treasury and RFV Backing Price, which are much easier to model since they only include the DAI stablecoin, the model can likely also apply to the Standalone Treasury (stablecoins + volatile assets like FTM but without LP tokens), see Credits for more infos on these other models.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Buybacks vs redemption</h2>
    <p>
        Both mechanisms intend to fulfill a similar purpose, which is to buy back tokens at a discounted price from the market to burn them and hence deflate the supply, which acts as a kind of inverse bonding process (bonding increases supply, redemptions/buybacks decreases it), in exchange for losing some of the treasury (and hence capital to get yield returns on). Despite their similar purpose, they have distinct pros and cons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Buybacks pros: since they do not happen at a specific time, as they are either <a href="https://discord.com/channels/902514779690790932/903000513988136990/937352085098340382">automatic but randomized (HEC staggered buybacks)</a> or manually done (TIME/WMEMO), they can be triggered at a much lower price and hence potentially produce a much better ROI for the protocol than redemptions. Cons: 1) Buybacks cannot maintain a stable spot price around the backing price hence affecting token holders trust, 2) they are more costly than redemptions due to slippage when buying on the market, hence buybacks can only be triggered at a lower spot price than redemptions to account for slippage and trading fees, whereas redemptions have none; 3) they provide no direct access to users to the treasury, hence buybacks cannot solve the digital reserve currency conundrum.
    </p>

        Redemptions pros: 1) since they are fully automated and externalized (it's not the protocol going to the market to buy back, it's token holders giving them directly to the protocol), redemptions should allow for near instantaneous price stabilization by applying an equal buying pressure to the selling pressure (ie, by arbitragers looping redemptions + spot buy until spot price is at backing price minus the fees they incur, so the spot price will stabilize slightly below the backing price); 2) the stabilized spot price provides an additional incentive to stake, since the interaction between the protocol's redemption function and arbitragers mostly guarantees that trying to trade below the backing price is risky, especially since the backing price increases monotonously during these periods; 3) redemption is a direct claim to the treasury for the token holders AND it guarantees a monotonous increase of the backing price if redemption threshold &lt;50%, hence providing one mechanism (but not sufficient on its own) to make the token a reserve currency. Redemptions cons: 1) even though using a redemption threshold &lt;50% guarantees the protocol will always redeem tokens with a net benefit (increasing the backing price), the protocol's benefits will always be (much) less than with buybacks, because redemption always buys higher than current spot price, whereas buybacks buy at spot price, and if done manually can even wait to buy the dip; 2) since it gives a direct access to the treasury to any user (if spot price &lt; backing price of course), it opens potential new attack vectors, one being an oracle attack as identified above.

    <h2>What is a reserve currency?</h2>
    <p>
        One of the major, and most incorrect, claims of all rebasing DAOs is that they are reserve currencies. While they do indeed own their liquidity (protocol owned liquidity POL), this is only one part of the equation. The other is to offer either a constant value, or a monotonously increasing value, the latter being the target obviously since the former can be done simply by tracking a reference asset such as a peg to USD or gold.
    </p>
    <p>
        In theory, rebasing DAOs initially could be seen as a reserve currency if bought at or below the backing price AND if willing to wait until the end of the runway period. Indeed, the runway period can be understood as the time needed to stake for the full dilution to happen until the token is so diluted (ie, so many tokens were minted) that the price per token has to be below $1, hence triggering the automatic $1 peg buyback, offering token holders the equivalent amount of treasury to the backing price that was displayed at the time they went in. Of course, in reality, due to minting and treasury yield ROI and other changes the rebasing DAO may have done meanwhile, the token holder may not receive exactly what was promised, but theoretically if the protocol only consisted of staking, this is what would happen. In other words, going beyond the runway is theoretically the only way for token holders to access the treasury of rebasing DAOs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The issue is that all rebasing DAOs decided to progressively or completely remove dilution by either reducing or eliminating staking rebases. The only projects that did not yet eliminate rebases clearly state nowadays that the rebases APY returns will diminish over time. While this eliminate one way of dilution, this also eliminates the only access users had on the treasury, since the protocol's owners can extend the runway indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence, automated (but not manual) buybacks or redemptions can be seen as not only a way to reduce selling pressure and spot price stabilization, but also as a mean for token holders to always have a direct claim on the treasury, which in turns is crucial for long-term trust, the key component of success for any financial project.
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that, properly parametrized redemptions and buybacks allow to increase the backing price, which combined with the fact they allow any token holder to use these mechanisms to directly access the treasury, means that the intrinsic value of the token monotonously increases when spot price &lt; backing price, which fulfills another requirement for a reserve currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, while these mechanisms provide a way to monotonously increase the intrinsic value when spot price &lt; backing price, they do not prevent inflation and intrinsic value devaluation when spot price &gt; backing price. Hence, redemptions and buybacks can only be a part of the solution to make an algorithmic reserve currency, there needs to also be a similar mechanism to increase the intrinsic value during positive trend markets.

    <h2>Prologue</h2>

    <p>
        SpartacusDAO's main developer Spartacus refused the proposal, choosing to drastically lower down APY from ~400,000% to &lt;1,000% instead, with no redemption nor buybacks, to preserve treasury at all costs.
    </p>

    <p>
        In December 2021, all rebasing DAOs (including OlympusDAO OHM) started a downtrend, which made them all reach below their backing price by the end of January 2022. This led to a resurgence of discussions on buyback and redemption mechanisms, which were mostly shunned in the past. On January 22nd, <a href="https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1020-oip-76-create-inverse-bond-policy-lever">OIP-76 on Ohm forums</a> proposed to implement the very same redemption mechanism as simulated here under the name of "inverse bonds".

        <li>This simulation was coded by Kromer aka Satoreph for the Spartacus.finance protocol. You can contact me at: satoreph a/t gmail dot com</li>
        <li>Many thanks to Romo who had the original idea to define a redemption threshold, which inspired this simulation, with the difference that their proposal was on the total treasury value instead of RFV treasury value (hence also including FTM and LP tokens) and that the Redeemable Threshold is configurable, with the assumption that &lt;50% may be more profitable for the protocol (which is false, 50% is optimal, see the Short Analysis sections for more details). Their spreadsheet, which show the same results, can be found here: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/901810422590627880/920429601338044466/921554042021371914">https://discord.com/channels/901810422590627880/920429601338044466/921554042021371914</a></li>
        <li>Kudos to anirudhab and Looser Spartan for their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/901810422590627880/902138528614469653/920898911479136266">initial suggestion</a> of a redemption mechanism inspired by ETFs, which in turns inspired Romo's suggestion and this simulation. More precisely, they proposed to use the Standalone treasury value (stablecoin + FTM, but not LP tokens).</li>
